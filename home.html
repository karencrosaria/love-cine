            <p> Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
                those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
